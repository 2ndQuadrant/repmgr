 <title>Handling network splits with repmgrd</title>
 <para>
  A common pattern for replication cluster setups is to spread servers over
  more than one datacentre. This can provide benefits such as geographically-
  distributed read replicas and DR (disaster recovery capability). However
  this also means there is a risk of disconnection at network level between
  datacentre locations, which would result in a split-brain scenario if
  servers in a secondary data centre were no longer able to see the primary
  in the main data centre and promoted a standby among themselves.

  Previous &repmgr; versions used the concept of a "witness server" to
  artificially create a quorum of servers in a particular location, ensuring
  that nodes in another location will not elect a new primary if they
  are unable to see the majority of nodes. However this approach does not
  scale well, particularly with more complex replication setups, e.g.
  where the majority of nodes are located outside of the primary datacentre.
  It also means the <literal>witness</literal> node needs to be managed as an
  extra PostgreSQL instance outside of the main replication cluster, which
  adds administrative and programming complexity.

 <para>
  <literal>repmgr4</literal> introduces the concept of <literal>location</literal>:
  each node is associated with an arbitrary location string (default is
  <literal>default</literal>); this is set in <filename>repmgr.conf</filename>, e.g.:
  <programlisting>
    node_id=1
    node_name=node1
    conninfo='host=node1 user=repmgr dbname=repmgr connect_timeout=2'
    data_directory='/var/lib/postgresql/data'
    location='dc1'</programlisting>
 </para>
 <para>
  In a failover situation, <application>repmgrd</application> will check if any servers in the
  same location as the current primary node are visible.  If not, <application>repmgrd</application>
  will assume a network interruption and not promote any node in any
  other location (it will however enter <xref linkend="repmgrd-degraded-monitoring"> mode until
  a primary becomes visible).

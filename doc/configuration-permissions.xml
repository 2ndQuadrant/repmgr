    &repmgr; will create an extension database containing objects
    for administering &repmgr; metadata. The user defined in the <varname>conninfo</varname>
    setting must be able to access all objects. Additionally, superuser permissions
    are required to install the &repmgr; extension. The easiest way to do this
    is create the &repmgr; user as a superuser, however if this is not
    desirable, the &repmgr; user can be created as a normal user and a
    superuser specified with <literal>--superuser</literal> when registering a &repmgr; node.

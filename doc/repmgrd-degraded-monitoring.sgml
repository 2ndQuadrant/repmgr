 <title>"degraded monitoring" mode</title>
 <para>
  In certain circumstances, `repmgrd` is not able to fulfill its primary mission
  of monitoring the nodes' upstream server. In these cases it enters "degraded
  monitoring" mode, where `repmgrd` remains active but is waiting for the situation
  to be resolved.
 </para>
 <para>
  Situations where this happens are:
  <itemizedlist spacing="compact" mark="bullet">

   <listitem>
    <simpara>a failover situation has occurred, no nodes in the primary node's location are visible</simpara>
   </listitem>

  Example output in a situation where there is only one standby with <literal>failover=manual</literal>,
  and the primary node is unavailable (but is later restarted):

 </para>
 <para>
  By default, <literal>repmgrd</literal> will continue in degraded monitoring mode indefinitely.
  However a timeout (in seconds) can be set with <varname>degraded_monitoring_timeout</varname>.

  <title>repmgr node rejoin</title>
  <para>
   Enables a dormant (stopped) node to be rejoined to the replication cluster.
  </para>
  <note>
   <simpara>
     Currently <command>repmgr node rejoin</command> can only be used to attach
     a standby to the current primary, not another standby.
   </simpara>
  </note>
  <para>
    This can optionally use <application>pg_rewind</application> to re-integrate a node which has diverged
    from the rest of the cluster, typically a failed primary.
  </para>
  <para>
    The node must have been shut down cleanly; if this was not the case, it will
    need to be manually started (remove any existing <filename>recovery.conf</filename> file first)
    until it has reached a consistent recovery point, then shut down cleanly.
  </para>
  <tip>
    <para>
      If <application>PostgreSQL</application> is started in single-user mode and
      input is directed from <filename>/dev/null/</filename>, it will perform recovery
      then immediately quit, and will then be in a state suitable for use by
      <application>pg_rewind</application>.
      <programlisting>
        rm -f /var/lib/pgsql/data/recovery.conf
        postgres --single -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/ < /dev/null
    </para>
  </tip>
  <para>
    Usage:
    <programlisting>
      repmgr node rejoin -d '$conninfo'</programlisting>

    where <literal>$conninfo</literal> is the conninfo string of any reachable node in the cluster.
    <filename>repmgr.conf</filename> for the stopped node *must* be supplied explicitly if not
    otherwise available.
  </para>
  <para>
    <command>repmgr node rejoin</command> can optionally use <command>pg_rewind</command> to re-integrate a
    node which has diverged from the rest of the cluster, typically a failed primary.
    <command>pg_rewind</command> is available in PostgreSQL 9.5 and later.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      <command>pg_rewind</command> *requires* that either <varname>wal_log_hints</varname> is enabled, or that
      data checksums were enabled when the cluster was initialized. See the
      <ulink url="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgrewind.html"><command>pg_rewind</command> documentation</ulink> for details.

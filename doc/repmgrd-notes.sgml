    <title>repmgrd and paused WAL replay</title>
    <para>
      If WAL replay has been paused (using <command>pg_wal_replay_pause()</command>,
      on PostgreSQL 9.6 and earlier <command>pg_xlog_replay_pause()</command>),
      in a failover situation <application>repmgrd</application> will
      automatically resume WAL replay.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is because if WAL replay is paused, but WAL is pending replay,
      PostgreSQL cannot be promoted until WAL replay is resumed.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        <command><link linkend="repmgr-standby-promote">repmgr standby promote</link></command>
        will refuse to promote a node in this state, as the PostgreSQL
        <command>promote</command> command will not be acted on until
        WAL replay is resumed, leaving the cluster in a potentially
        unstable state. In this case it is up to the user to
        decide whether to resume WAL replay.

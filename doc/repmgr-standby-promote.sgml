  <para>
   Promotes a standby to a primary if the current primary has failed. This
   command requires a valid <filename>repmgr.conf</filename> file for the standby, either
   specified explicitly  with <literal>-f/--config-file</literal> or located in a
    default location; no additional arguments are required.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the standby promotion succeeds, the server will not need to be
   restarted. However any other standbys will need to follow the new server,
   by using <xref linkend="repmgr-standby-follow">; if <application>repmgrd</application>
   is active, it will handle this automatically.

    Example execution:

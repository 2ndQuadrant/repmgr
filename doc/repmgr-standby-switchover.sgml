  <para>
    Promotes a standby to primary and demotes the existing primary to a standby.
    This command must be run on the standby to be promoted, and requires a
    passwordless SSH connection to the current primary.
  </para>
  <para>
    If other standbys are connected to the demotion candidate, &repmgr; can instruct
    these to follow the new primary if the option <literal>--siblings-follow</literal>
    is specified.
  </para>
  <para>
    Execute with the <literal>--dry-run</literal> option to test the switchover as far as
    possible without actually changing the status of either node.
  </para>
  <para>
    <command>repmgrd</command> should not be active on any nodes while a switchover is being
    executed. This restriction may be lifted in a later version.

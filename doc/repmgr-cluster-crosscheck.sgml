  <para>
    <command>repmgr cluster crosscheck</command> is similar to <xref linkend="repmgr-cluster-matrix">,
    but cross-checks connections between each combination of nodes. In "Example 3" in
    <xref linkend="repmgr-cluster-matrix"> we have no information about the state of <literal>node3</literal>.
    However by running <command>repmgr cluster crosscheck</command> it's possible to get a better
    overview of the cluster situation:
    <programlisting>
    $ repmgr -f /etc/repmgr.conf cluster crosscheck

    Name   | Id |  1 |  2 |  3
    -------+----+----+----+----
     node1 |  1 |  * |  * |  x
     node2 |  2 |  * |  * |  *
     node3 |  3 |  * |  * |  *</programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
   What happened is that <command>repmgr cluster crosscheck</command> merged its own
   <command>repmgr cluster matrix</command> with the <command>repmgr cluster matrix</command>
   output from <literal>node2</literal>; the latter is able to connect to <literal>node3</literal>
   and therefore determine the state of outbound connections from that node.

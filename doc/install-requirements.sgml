  <title>Requirements for installing repmgr</title>
  <para>
    repmgr is developed and tested on Linux and OS X, but should work on any
    UNIX-like system supported by PostgreSQL itself. There is no support for
    Microsoft Windows.
  </para>

  <para>
   From version 4.0, repmgr is compatible with all PostgreSQL versions from 9.3.
   Note that some &repmgr; functionality is not available in PostgreSQL 9.3 and PostgreSQL 9.4.
  </para>

  <note>
   <simpara>
    If upgrading from &repmgr; 3.x, please see the section <xref linkend="upgrading-from-repmgr-3">.
   </simpara>
  </note>

  <para>
   All servers in the replication cluster must be running the same major version of
   PostgreSQL, and we recommend that they also run the same minor version.
  </para>

  <para>
   &repmgr; must be installed on each server in the replication cluster.
   If installing repmgr from packages, the package version must match the PostgreSQL
   version. If installing from source, &repmgr; must be compiled against the same
   major version.
  </para>

  <para>
   A dedicated system user for &repmgr; is <emphasis>not</emphasis> required; as many &repmgr; and
   <application>repmgrd</application> actions require direct access to the PostgreSQL data directory,
   these commands should be executed by the <literal>postgres</literal> user.
  </para>

    for information on networking requirements.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <simpara>
    We recommend using a session multiplexer utility such as <command>screen</command> or
    <command>tmux</command> when performing long-running actions (such as cloning a database)
    on a remote server - this will ensure the &repmgr; action won't be prematurely
    terminated if your <command>ssh</command> session to the server is interrupted or closed.

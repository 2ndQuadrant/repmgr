  <title>repmgr standby register</title>
  <para>
   <command>repmgr standby register</command> adds a standby's information to
   the &repmgr; metadata. This command needs to be executed to enable
   promote/follow operations and to allow <application>repmgrd</application> to work with the node.
   An existing standby can be registered using this command. Execute with the
   <literal>--dry-run</literal> option to check what would happen without actually registering the
   standby.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      If providing the configuration file location with <literal>-f/--config-file</literal>,
      avoid using a relative path, as &repmgr; stores the configuration file location
      in the repmgr metadata for use when &repmgr; is executed remotely (e.g. during
      <xref linkend="repmgr-standby-switchover">). &repmgr; will attempt to convert the
      a relative path into an absolute one, but this may not be the same as the path you
      would explicitly provide (e.g. <filename>./repmgr.conf</filename> might be converted
      to <filename>/path/to/./repmgr.conf</filename>, whereas you'd normally write
      <filename>/path/to/repmgr.conf</filename>).

   <title>Waiting for the registration to propagate to the standby</title>
   <para>
     Depending on your environment and workload, it may take some time for
     the standby's node record to propagate from the primary to the standby. Some
     actions (such as starting <application>repmgrd</application>) require that the standby's node record
     is present and up-to-date to function correctly.
   </para>
   <para>
    By providing the option <literal>--wait-sync</literal> to the
    <command>repmgr standby register</command> command, &repmgr; will wait
    until the record is synchronised before exiting. An optional timeout (in
    seconds) can be added to this option (e.g. <literal>--wait-sync=60</literal>).
   </para>

  <sect1 id="repmgr-standby-register-inactive-node" xreflabel="Registering an inactive node">
   <title>Registering an inactive node</title>
   <para>
    Under some circumstances you may wish to register a standby which is not
    yet running; this can be the case when using provisioning tools to create
    a complex replication cluster. In this case, by using the <literal>-F/--force</literal>
    option and providing the connection parameters to the primary server,
    the standby can be registered.
   </para>
   <para>
    Similarly, with cascading replication it may be necessary to register
    a standby whose upstream node has not yet been registered - in this case,
    using <literal>-F/--force</literal> will result in the creation of an inactive placeholder
    record for the upstream node, which will however later need to be registered
    with the <literal>-F/--force</literal> option too.
   </para>
   <para>
    When used with <command>repmgr standby register</command>, care should be taken that use of the
    <literal>-F/--force</literal> option does not result in an incorrectly configured cluster.
   </para>

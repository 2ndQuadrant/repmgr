 <title>repmgrd and cascading replication</title>
 <para>
  Cascading replication - where a standby can connect to an upstream node and not
  the primary server itself - was introduced in PostgreSQL 9.2. &repmgr; and
  <application>repmgrd</application> support cascading replication by keeping track of the relationship
  between standby servers - each node record is stored with the node id of its
  upstream ("parent") server (except of course the primary server).
 </para>
 <para>
  In a failover situation where the primary node fails and a top-level standby
  is promoted, a standby connected to another standby will not be affected
  and continue working as normal (even if the upstream standby it's connected
  to becomes the primary node). If however the node's direct upstream fails,
  the &quot;cascaded standby&quot; will attempt to reconnect to that node's parent
  (unless <varname>failover</varname> is set to <literal>manual</literal> in
  <filename>repmgr.conf</filename>).

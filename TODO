Known issues in repmgr
======================

* When running repmgr against a remote machine, operations that start
  the database server using the ``pg_ctl`` command may accidentally
  terminate after their associated ssh session ends.

Planned feature improvements
============================

* Timeline increases when promoting a standby

* A better check which standby did receive most of the data

* Make the fact that a standby may be delayed a factor in the voting
  algorithm

* include support for delayed standbys

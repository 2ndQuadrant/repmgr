Known issues in repmgr
======================

* When running repmgr against a remote machine, operations that start
  the database server using the ``pg_ctl`` command may accidentally
  terminate after their associated ssh session ends.

* PGPASSFILE may not be passed to pg_basebackup

Planned feature improvements
============================

* A better check which standby did receive most of the data

* Make the fact that a standby may be delayed a factor in the voting
  algorithm

* include support for delayed standbys

* Create the repmgr user/database on "master register".

* Use pg_basebackup for the data directory, and ALSO rsync for the
configuration files.

* If no configuration file supplied, search in sensible default locations
  (currently: current directory and `pg_config --sysconfdir`); if
  possible this should include the location provided by the package,
  if installed.

* repmgrd: if connection to the upstream node fails on startup, optionally
  retry for a certain period before giving up; this will cover cases when
  e.g. primary and standby are both starting up, and the standby comes up
  before the primary. See github issue #80/

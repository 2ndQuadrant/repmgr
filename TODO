Known issues in repmgr
======================

* When running repmgr against a remote machine, operations that start
  the database server using the ``pg_ctl`` command may accidentally
  terminate after their associated ssh session ends.

* After running repmgrd as a regular foreground application, hitting
  control-C causes the program to crash.

Planned feature improvements
